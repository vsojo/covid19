# CovRex: An adaptable agent-based model of viral spread and symptom progression for the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pandemic
:construction: **This model is under construction!** :construction:

This is a simple interactive epidemiological model of viral spread.
It intends to address the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the sanitary effects of COVID-19.

The model is developed as a Jupyter Notebook. If you wish to run the model and interact with it, we suggest you [open the model on the Google Colab cloud](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vsojo/covid19/blob/master/Covid19_model.ipynb). You will not need to install anything.

Once in Colab, you should be able to browse the model and some output just like you would a passive website. But you can also change parameters and run the model yourself, on Google's servers. To do this, you will need to log in with a Google-enabled account (apologies for that limitation). Then you will need to click Runtime > Run all in the menu at the top left.

:warning: You will be given a warning that Google did not develop this code (because they didn't â€“ we did). You will need to accept this warning if you wish to run the code. Otherwise you should still be able to browse this document, but you will not be able to change or execute the code beyond that.

Alternatively, if you are familiar Jupyter Notebooks and are willing to install the necessary libraries, you can freely download the `.ipynb` file (which contains the whole model) from either Colab or GitHub.
