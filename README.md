# A simple epidemiological agen-based model of viral spread and hospital saturation
:construction: **This model is under construction!** :construction:

This is a simple interactive epidemiological model of viral spread.
It intends to address the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the sanitary effects of Covid-19.

The model is being developed as a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab. If you wish to run the model and interact with it, we suggest you [do it in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vsojo/covid19/blob/master/Covid19_model.ipynb).

Once in Colab, you should be able to browse the model and some output just like you would a passive website. But you can also change parameters and run the model yourself, on Google's servers. To do this, you will need to log in with a Google-enabled account (apologies for that limitation). Then you will need to click Runtime > Run all in the menu at the top left.

:warning: You will be given a warning that Google did not develop this code (because they didn't â€“ we did). You will need to accept this warning if you wish to run the code. Otherwise you should still be able to browse this document, but you will not be able to change or execute the code beyond that.

Alternatively, if you are familiar Jupyter Notebooks, you can freely download this document (which contains the whole model) from either Colab or GitHub, but you may need to modify a few Google-specific bits (chiefly Google Widgets, which may not run on normal Jupyter).
