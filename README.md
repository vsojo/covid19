### This model is under construction! ###

This is a simple interactive epidemiological model of viral spread.
It intends to address the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the sanitary effects of Covid-19.

The model has been developed as a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.
If you wish to run the model and interact with it, you can download the .ipynb file,if you know how to use those.

Much easier, and PREFERABLE: you can open the notebook in Colab directly. 
You will need a Google account for this. Please follow the link "Open in Colab" at the top, and log in to Google.
You should be able to select different parameters and run the code.
You can also alter the code itself if you install Colab into your Google Drive.

If you do find something that can be improved or want to collaborate, please contact Victor Sojo at:
